## Amplitude module
In order to work with the 'Amplitude' module, the vectors must have been first created and imported using the first module.
Finally, to show the results something such as:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

plt.plot(A)
```

or 

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline

plt.plot(f)
```

is recommended to plot the amplitudes (for the first case) and the frequencies (for the second).
